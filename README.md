# Lexy2
Compiler for my programming language.

## Building
CMake is configured to call ANTLR so no further action here is needed.
The code generated by ANTLR will be in `libs` directory.

When building on Windows for GCC using [these official guidelines](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master/runtime/Cpp/cmake) you may encounter this error (at least that's what happened to me):
`No rule to make target 'antlr4_runtime/src/antlr4_runtime/runtime/Cpp/runtime/libantlr4-runtime.a'`.
To solve it I modified `cmake/ExternalAntlr4Cpp.cmake` as suggested by Giampiero [here](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/4141).

### My environment
* gcc.exe (Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project) 12.2.0
* cmake version 3.25.0
* GNU Make 4.4.1. Built for Windows32
