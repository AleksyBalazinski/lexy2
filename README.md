# Lexy2
Compiler for my programming language.

## Building the project
Note that this will download and build the ANTLR runtime so it will take a while to build the project for the first time.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
# specify a sane generator for Windows
cmake ../ -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
./lexy2
```

CMake is configured to call ANTLR so no further action here is needed.
The code generated by ANTLR will be in `libs` directory.

ANTLR can also be called manually with
```bash
 antlr4 <grammar files> -Dlanguage=Cpp -listener -o libs
```

Sidenote:
> When building on Windows with GCC using [these official guidelines](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master/runtime/Cpp/cmake) you may encounter this error (at least that's what happened to me):
> `No rule to make target 'antlr4_runtime/src/antlr4_runtime/runtime/Cpp/runtime/libantlr4-runtime.a'`.
> To solve it I modified `cmake/ExternalAntlr4Cpp.cmake` as suggested by Giampiero [here](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/4141).
